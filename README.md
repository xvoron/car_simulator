= Deep Q-learning agent for 2D car simulator = 

This project is my attempt to learn Pygame library and to understand
basics of Deep Q-learning algorithm. 

= Files =
- ai.py:
    - class Nework - create a network.
    - class ReplayMemory - create a memory from where we will take a samples.
    - DQL_agent - main part of the algorithm

- car_ai.py

- car_module.py
- environment.py
- main.py
- map_module.py
- rays.py:
    - class Ray - class to manipulate with one geometrical Ray 
    - class Rays - create and manipulate with bunch of rays (wraper for class
      Ray)
- simulator.py
